Welcome to the **Custom Connector Masterclass** at Power Platform Community Conference 2025! 🚀

## 📋 Workshop Overview

In the Power Platform there are more than 1600 connectors available out of the box. This is a huge amount and offers you great functionality from the get-go. But what if you need to connect to a data source or a service that is not available in the Power Platform? Or what if you want to customize the functionality or the user interface of an existing connector? This is where custom connectors come in.

# Lab 00 - Preparations & Environment

In this lab, you will go through the following tasks:

* Creating a new browser profile
* Logging into the account you are going to use during the workshop
* Access your Power Platform developer environment

## üë• Create a new browser profile

It's always good to have a separate browser profile for your work and for workshops like this. This way you can keep all of your credentials separate and not have to worry about logging out of your personal / work accounts. In the example we will be using Microsoft Edge, **instead you can also use any other Browser, just make sure to use a profile where you are not logged in with any other Microsoft Account!**

### Install Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge comes pre-installed on Windows 10 and 11. If you need to install or update it, otherwise go directly to the new step:

* Download from [microsoft.com/edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
* Run the installer and follow the prompts
* Edge will auto-update in the background

### Create a new profile

1. Open Microsoft Edge
2. Click on the profile icon on the top left corner
3. Hover over "Other Microsoft Edge Browsers" / "Other profiles" and then select **Add Browser** / **Add profile**

    This will then open up a new browser window on your taskbar.

6. In the new browser window, select **Start without your data**

    It may prompt you to configure your new browser theme. If this happens, just select **Next** and then **Finish**.
